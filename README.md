# rustystack-backend
a backend for the rustystack, entirely made with rocket framework
currently in a very simplistic state but expected to grow
***
# instructions
make a `Rocket.toml` file, and give it the following content
```toml
[global]
address = "your server's public IPv4 address"
port = 80
```
this will then start hosting the site on your provided address
